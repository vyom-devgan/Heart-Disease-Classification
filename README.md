# Heart-Disease-Classification

Build different machine learning models to predict if a given person has heart disease.
## Atributes
1. age (years)
2. sex (0: female, 1: male)
3. chest pain type (0: typical angina, 1: atypical angina, 2: non-anginal pain, and 3: asymptomatic)
4. resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
5. serum cholestoral (mg/dl)
6. fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl)
7. resting electrocardiographic results (0: Normal, 1: abnormality, 2: LVT))
8. maximum heart rate achieved (bpm)
9. exercise induced angina (0: no, 1: yes)
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

## Target
1. Heart Disease (2 values)
